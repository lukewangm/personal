I wrote this page mouse free!

    I am currently practicing how to use this thing i learned called VIM
    However, I am still trying to get used to it. When I make typing errors,
    I dont utilize what VIM hast to offer because I use press backspace a 
    ton of times. I hope that I can be able to fully utilize it, but for now
    I will use practice having it available in my toolbox.

The current VIM commands I know in NORMAL Mode are:

    *This can be used in combination with command and option*

    **INSERT MODE**
    option+shift+[up|down] - copy line up/down
    esc - exit to NORMAL mode
    ctrl + b - move cursor left
    ctrl + f - move cursor right
    cmd + arrow - move to absolute direction

    **NORMAL MODE**
    hjkl - curser movement
    v - VISUAL mode
    a|A|i|I - enter INSERT mode
    u - undo previous action
    dd - delete a line
    d - followed by number and [h|j|k|l] to delete x characters
    x - delete character in cursor
    r - replace character in cursor
    yy - copy a line
    p - paste a line
    g_ - go to end of line
    :x - go to line x
