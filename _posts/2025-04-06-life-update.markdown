It has been a minute since I've written to this blog. I guess it's never been truly. However, I think I will start using it more since I want to express my thoughts more and also try to write more. I've been watching a lot of tv in my free time, and not doing enough self reflection. Writing is a means for me to organize my thoughts and I have a feeling it will help me accompolish my goals better.

I've been working at Silvus full-time for the past couple of months. I started back in June as an intern and I have been fortunate to be able to transition to part-time and now full-time. I enjoy the work that I do and there is so much to learn. I've been doing mostly front-end development, which I am not upset about. I do have the desire to do more though. When I think back to my time at USC, a lot of what I learned involve things happening under the hood and not a lot of visualization stuff. That being said, I think a mixture of both making visuals and writing backend code would make me feel best.

I've been failing to realize that I can also do a lot of that on my own. That's partly why I am trying to start this blog up. So I can document stuff that I do as well as keeping myself accountable to do it. I want to be better at using D3 to visualize stuff, but also try out other visual libraries like threejs.

Other than that, I have been climbing more these past couple of weeks as I prepare to go to bishop with the guys. I do need to take it a bit easy this week though, because I feel as if my forearms are chronically tight and I think that is a sign of overuse. There's also been a lot of thought regarding how else I can spend my time. Being a full-time worker is so different from being a full-time student. There is no homework and once I clock out I supposively am to not think about work. I am still trying to get used to that concept.

I also think I should think of a different way to approach the deployment of this website because I don't know how sustainable it would be for me to just make commits everytime I want to write a post. There's nothing bad about it persay. Maybe, I will just make the branch private.

This is good for now. I won't be proofreading this either, since this is more a stream of consciousness.
