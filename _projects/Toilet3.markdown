Toilet3 is the Yelp of bathroom finders. 

Toilet3 is revolutionizing the way you find and rate bathrooms, aka. the Yelp of bathroom finders.

Our app enables you to effortlessly locate nearby bathrooms and provide ratings based on your experiences.

Using a social adjacent model, Toilet3 fosters user engagement through features like likes and comments, enhancing community interaction.

I prototyped the app using Figma and with the team conducted extensive research to understand and meet consumer needs effectively.

See demo in link below:
