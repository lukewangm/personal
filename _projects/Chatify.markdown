In this project, I focused on configuring Java servlets to enhance server capabilities for web applications. Doing so, I was able to manage client interactions through a request-response model over the network using HTTP protocols. This involved validating user credentials securely during login and managing the secure storage of new user information upon registration.

Additionally, I managed the data in Google Cloud, utilizing SQL to interact with and manipulate our database. Tasks included querying data, inserting and updating records, and ensuring transactional integrity within the cloud-based database environment.

Please see video below for demo:
